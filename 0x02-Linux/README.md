## Cheat Sheet

### Basic comands

* sudo

    * -l, --list  If no command is specified, list the allowed (and forbidden) commands for the invoking user (or the user specified by the -U option) on the current host.  A longer list format is used if this option is specified multiple times and the security policy supports a verbose output format. 
    If a command is specified and is permitted by the security policy, the fully-qualified path to the command is displayed along with any command line arguments.  If a command is specified but not allowed by the policy, sudo will exit with a status value of 1.

```bash
sudo -l
```
